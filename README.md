Good Nature Vegan Food: A Brief History
Founded: 2018 
Location: Johannesburg, South Africa

Good Nature Vegan Food began as a single vegan restaurant in Johannesburg, committed to serving fresh, locally sourced plant based meals. From the start, it aimed to make ethical eating both accessible and enjoyable for the local community.
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the business quickly adapted to the changing landscape. It introduced online booking systems to ensure safe, contactless service and launched a digital recipe-sharing platform. This allowed customers to recreate their favourite dishes at home, fostering a sense of connection and continuity during lockdown. (Copilot, 2025)
Through innovation and community engagement, Good Nature Vegan Food not only survived the pandemic but also strengthened its brand. It became a local pioneer in blending sustainability with digital convenience, inspiring other small businesses to follow suit.
